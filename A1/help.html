                        <ol>
                            <li>CSS framework can help engineers develop websites faster</li>
                            <li>CSS framework can quickly build wireframe or prototype projects</li>

                        <h3><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a></h3>
                        <p>Bootstrap is currently the most widely used CSS framework.
                            It is an open source toolkit for front-end development launched by Twitter.
                            The most popular version is Bootstrap 4 released in 2018. Compared to Bootstrap 3,
                            Bootstrap 4 adds many features and functions, such as new color schemes, new modifiers,
                            and new utility classifications. In addition, Bootstrap 4 is built using SASS,
                            which means that Bootstrap is now applicable to both LESS and SASS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="https://get.foundation/">Foundation</a></h3>
                        <p>Compared with other CSS frameworks, Foundation is relatively professional and has more comprehensive functions,
                            so it is also difficult to learn. As a more advanced and more complex framework, Foundation is super readable,
                            flexible and customizable. These features also make it one of the preferred frameworks for creating responsive websites and applications.
                            Many large websites, such as Facebook, Ebay, Mozilla, Disney, Adobe, etc., use this framework.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="https://purecss.io/">Pure</a></h3>
                        <p>Pure is a lightweight responsive CSS framework created by Yahoo in 2014. It is built on Normalize.css,
                            and developers can use its grid design and menus to create highly responsive page layouts.
                            Unlike Bootstrap, Pure is responsive by default, so responsive options cannot be disabled.
                            In addition, as the name suggests, Pure is a pure CSS framework that does not contain any JavaScript components and is very light and small.
                            The entire module is only 3.8KB compressed.</p>

                        <h3><a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a></h3>
                        <p>Bulma is a free and open source project based on the Flexbox layout model.
                            The CSS framework is also lightweight, responsive, and has a mobile-first concept. For developers,
                            Bulma, Bootstrap and Foundation can be listed as the three most popular CSS frameworks. Currently,
                            more than 150,000 developers worldwide are using Bulma. The reason why Bulma is so popular is its highly readable naming rules,
                            which for novice developers will greatly reduce the cost of learning. There is another interesting point.
                            Bulma can be said to be a star player on Github, and is very popular.</p>

                            which can quickly build beautiful web pages. Semantic UI also integrates many third-party resource libraries,
