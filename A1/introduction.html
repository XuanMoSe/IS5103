                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                    This separation can improve content accessibility,
                    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
                    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in
                    a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
                    as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                <h2><strong>Variations of CSS</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    CSS has various levels and profiles.
                    Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted
                    as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4.
                    Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface.
                    Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets.
                    Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.

            <div class="content">
                <h2><strong>CSS1</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1,
                    published on December 17, 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers.
                    Among its capabilities are support for
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Font properties such as typeface and emphasis</li>
                    <li>Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements</li>
                    <li>Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text</li>
                    <li>Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements</li>
                    <li>Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements</li>
                    <li>Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content">
                <h2><strong>CSS2</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998.
                    A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative,
                    and fixed positioning of elements and z-index,
                    the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules) and bidirectional text,
                    and new font properties such as shadows.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h2><strong>CSS2.1</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2,
                    removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification.
                    To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications,
                    CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years.
                    CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft
                    on June 13, 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009.
                    However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h2><strong>CSS3</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features,
                    CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules".
                    Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2,
                    preserving backward compatibility.
                    Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation.
                    The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h2><strong>CSS4</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification,
                    because the specification has been split into many separate modules which level independently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modules that build on things from CSS Level 2 started at Level 3.
                    Some of them have already reached Level 4 or are already approaching Level 5.
                    Other modules that define entirely new functionality, such as Flexbox,
                    have been designated as Level 1 and some of them are approaching Level 2.
